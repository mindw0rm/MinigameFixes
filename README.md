# MinigameFixes

some workarounds and features for bugs in minigame plugins for minecraft-kids.online

* when logging in or tepleporting to the lobby area, the inventory of non-op plyers is cleared
* cannot move below Y=1 when in spectator mode
* forbid opening of containers in playing Village Defense
* in parkour courses, en enchanting table will give players elytras, and walking on red nether bricks will remove them. 
* prevent opening of player inventory in Parkour (because it is not required anyway, and that'S the easiest to prevent players from putting elytras somewhere else :P )
* add a worldguard region flag that allows to configure the explosion radius of TNT.
